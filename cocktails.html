        <h2>The Aesclipius</h2>
        <p> <strong>What is a hospital for?</strong></p>
        <p> "If the hospital is merely a mechanical body shop, then we live in a less than fully human world" P. 26</p>

        <h2>The Crito</h2>
        <p><strong>Should we be obedient to power or goodness?</strong></p>
        <p>“If God asked me to kill my son, fi rst I’d question if the voice
was God. Then I’d tell the voice to go fuck itself.” P. 21</p>

    <div class="block">
        <h2>The Phaedo</h2>
        <p><strong>What happens after death?</strong></p>
        <p>"In the Phaedo, just an hour before his death, Socrates says, “Philosophy is nothing but the preparation for death and dying.”13 (“No way
to recruit majors,” my former professor Johanna Meehan used to say.)
Among other things, this statement means that philosophers must
confront the fact of their deaths and, by implication, the fact of their
lives; for life and death are stages of one underlying cycle." P. 27</p>
